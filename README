#        USAGE:  ./checknet.pl                                                  #
#                perl checknet.pl                                               #
#                                                                               #
#  DESCRIPTION:  First I checked if the internet was up by launching a browser  #
#                and going to www.google.com.                                   #
#                The I decided to start pinging it. Finally, I added an endless #
#                loop and stuck in 'espeak' so I didnt have to sit at the       #
#                computer all day. This was in bash. I finally decided to port  #
#                it to perl, in order to clean it up a bit. This is the outcome.#
#                The program will ping google. If it get's a solid connection   #
#                (all packets received), then it will say "Internet!" and try   #
#                again. It will remain quiet until the solid connection is lost.#
#                To quit, use your shell's terminate sequence. In bash it's     #
#                CTRL-C.                                                        #
#                                                                               #
#      OPTIONS:  Pass it options just like you would pass ping. In fact, if you #
#                bring it up as ./checknet -h, it will output ping's help and   #
#                possible do weird stuff. Maybe when I learn command line       #
#                switches I'll fix that.                                        #
#                                                                               #
# REQUIREMENTS:  perl, ping, UNIX prompt, espeak                                #
#         BUGS:  Probably many                                                  #
